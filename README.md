# 🕵️‍♂️ CredGear
cred gear is a high-performance data sanitization tool designed to extract, normalize, and deduplicate credentials from unstructured text sources, delivering clean, analysis-ready data.

## What is CRED GEAR?

CRED GEAR processes raw credential dumps (logs, leaks, text files, scraped content) and converts them into structured, normalized JSON, removing noise and duplicates along the way.

It is ideal for:

- Security research
- Incident response
- Data analysis
- Credential hygiene pipelines
- Automation workflows
